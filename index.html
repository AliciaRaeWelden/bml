<h1 id="build-instructions">Build Instructions</h1>

<p>The bml library is built with CMake.  For your convenience, we provide
a shell script which goes through the necessary motions and builds the
library, runs the tests, and installs it (in the <code>install</code> directory).
Simply run:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./build.sh compile
</code></pre>

<p>and the library will be built in the <code>build</code> directory.  In case you
change any sources and simply want to rebuild the library, you don’t
have to run <code>build.sh</code> again, but rather</p>

<pre><code>$ make -C build
</code></pre>

<p>The compiled library can be installed by running</p>

<pre><code>$ make -C build install
</code></pre>

<p>which by default installs in <code>/usr/local</code>.  The install directory can
be modified by running</p>

<pre><code>$ CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path ./build.sh configure
</code></pre>

<p>(which assumes that you are using the bash shell).</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>In order to build the library, the following tools need to be installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>gcc</code> with Fortran support</li>
  <li><code>&gt;=cmake-2.8.8</code></li>
  <li><code>&gt;=python-2.7</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="if-the-build-fails">If the build fails</h2>

<p>In case the build fails for some reason, please email the developers
at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#113;&#109;&#109;&#100;&#045;&#097;&#108;&#108;&#064;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#108;&#046;&#103;&#111;&#118;">&#113;&#109;&#109;&#100;&#045;&#097;&#108;&#108;&#064;&#108;&#097;&#110;&#108;&#046;&#103;&#111;&#118;</a> or open an issue on github
(https://github.com/qmmd/bml/issues) and attach the files</p>

<pre><code>build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log
build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log
</code></pre>

<h1 id="developer-suggested-workflow">Developer Suggested Workflow</h1>

<p>We do our main development on the <code>develop</code> branch.  If you would like
to contribute your work to the bml project, please fork the project on
github, hack away at the forked <code>develop</code> branch and send us a pull
request once you think we should have a look and integrate your work.</p>

<h2 id="coding-style">Coding Style</h2>

<p>Please indent your C code using</p>

<pre><code>$ indent -gnu -nut -i4 -bli0 -cli4 -ppi0 -cbi0 -npcs -bfda
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the script <code>indent.sh</code> to indent all C code.</p>
